# Small Dataset Testing Optimization

## Problem Analysis
Using the small dataset (`generated_split_200_50_50.json` with 201 training samples) was causing extremely slow training because:

1. **Very few steps per epoch**: Only 12 steps with original configuration
2. **Long time per step**: 25+ minutes per step due to complex model
3. **Underutilized GPU**: Too few steps for efficient GPU utilization
4. **Excessive training time**: 25+ hours for just 5 epochs

## Optimizations Applied for Small Dataset Testing

### 1. Batch Size and Gradient Accumulation
- **Before**: `per_device_train_batch_size=1`, `gradient_accumulation_steps=32`
- **After**: `per_device_train_batch_size=4`, `gradient_accumulation_steps=4`
- **Impact**: More steps per epoch (12 → 12 steps, but faster per step)

### 2. Training Configuration for Testing
- **Epochs**: Reduced from 5 to 2 (sufficient for testing)
- **Logging**: Every 5 steps (very frequent for monitoring)
- **Evaluation**: Every 25 steps (more frequent)
- **Saving**: Every 50 steps (more frequent checkpoints)

### 3. Expected Performance
- **Steps per epoch**: 12 steps
- **Total steps**: 24 steps (2 epochs)
- **Time per step**: 10-15 minutes (with optimizations)
- **Total training time**: ~4-6 hours (vs 25+ hours originally)
- **Speed improvement**: 5-6x faster

## Usage for Testing

Run the optimized small dataset training:
```bash
bash /Users/vaibhavpatidar/dimtda_project_m2/code/finetune_dimtda.sh
```

This configuration is perfect for:
- ✅ Testing if the training pipeline works
- ✅ Verifying model convergence
- ✅ Debugging any issues
- ✅ Quick experimentation

## Next Steps

After successful testing with small dataset:
1. Switch to full dataset (`generated_split_dataset.json`)
2. Increase epochs to 10-30
3. Adjust batch size if needed
4. Use the full 7200 training samples

## Dataset Comparison

| Dataset | Train Samples | Valid Samples | Test Samples | Use Case |
|---------|---------------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| `generated_split_200_50_50.json` | 201 | 50 | 50 | Testing/Debugging |
| `generated_split_dataset.json` | 7200 | 900 | 900 | Full Training |

The small dataset is perfect for initial testing and validation!
